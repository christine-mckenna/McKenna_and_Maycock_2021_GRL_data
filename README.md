# DJF NAO index data for CMIP5, CMIP6 and MMLEA models

Annual mean DJF NAO index data for historical and RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5 simulations from CMIP5, CMIP6 and MMLEA models. Data is described in detail in [McKenna and Maycock (2021)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL093258).

CMIP files are given for each ensemble member. MMLEA files contain all ensemble members in ascending order (r1i1p1 to rNi1p1). Years covered by each file are given in the filename.
